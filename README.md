# 100 Days of Python Challenge

This is a challenge following the Udemy course '100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022'. I began this course a few months ago before some big changes happened and so put it on hold. I am now working between this and other projects so am aiming to complete a challenge every 2 days. As I began the course before (with results posted on my twitter account) I have begun this repo from day 12.

## Personal Goals
I aim to use this challenge to keep practicing my python skills and learn how to write better code. With that in mind I am looking to write code in a modular and reproducable fashion (I won't always succeed at this!) while also attempting to not over-engineer the solution.
